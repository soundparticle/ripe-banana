# Ripe-Banana Movie Reviews
This is a basic app I build with some help from my collaborator Robyn Navarro. The app allows for reviewers to signup and submit reviews of their favorite films! Users can search without signing up. This app allows for a database of actors, films, and film studios, to be created and added to over time. Reviewers have a lit of their reviews, which in turn lists the actors and studios which can then be searched, returning the list of films or studios they've been associated with. This app is the very beginning of what a full fledged movie review site like "Rotten Tomatoes" might start out like, at its most basic.
All actors, studios, and films, can be deleted, but if an actor is in a film listed in the database, or if a film is listed, they cannot be deleted. 

## This app uses:
ExpressJS: for routing.
MongoDB/Mongoose: for database and schemas.
NodeJS
