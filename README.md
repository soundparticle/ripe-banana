# Ripe-Banana Movie Reviews
This is a basic app that allows for independent reviewers to signup and submit reviews of their favorite films! This app also allows for a database of actors and film studios that are related to the movies contained in the database. Reviewers have a lit of their reviews, which in turn lists the actors and studios which can then be searched and return the list of films or studios they've been associated with. This app is a very beginning of what a full featured movie review site like "Rotten Tomatos" might start out like, at its most basic.
All actors, studios, and films, can be deleted, but if an actor is in a film listed in the database, or if a film is listed, they cannot be deleted.
