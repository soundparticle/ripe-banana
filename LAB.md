## Description

For this assignment, you'l be creating a database of movie films (with reviews), movie studios, actors, reviews and reviewers.

## Working on this Lab

1. Work vertically. That means build the tests, route and model for one entity/resource at a time. Horizontal would be building all the mongoose models first. Don't do that, go vertical!
1. Start with the entities/resources that don't depend on other resources: `Studio`, `Actor`, and `Reviewer`
1. Work in groups of 2 (one group of 3) on this lab
1. Those of you in groups of 3 need to be careful about three people around one computer. 
Unless you work together at a fast pace, split up the work (but split it vertically!). 
You need to set a good pace to get through the work in the allotted time.

### Entities/Resources

* Studio
* Film
* Actor
* Reviewer
* Review

#### Directions Key
* `<...>` is a placeholder for actual data.
* `S` = string, `D` = date, `N` = number, `I` = ObjectId
* Properties marked with `R` are required.

#### Studio

```
{
  name: <name-of-studio RS>,
  address: {
    city: <city S>
    state: <state S>
    country: <country S>
  }
}
```

#### Film

```
{
  title: <title of film RS>,
  studio: <studio _id RI>,
  released: <4-digit year RN>,
  cast: [{
    part: <name of character S>,
    actor: <actor _id RI>
  }]
}
```

#### Actor

```
{ 
  name: <name RS>,
  dob: <date-of-birth D>,
  pob: <place-of-birth S>
}
```

#### Reviewer

```
{ 
  name: <string RS>,
  company: <company or website name RS>
}
```


#### Review

```
{ 
  rating: <rating number 1-5 RN>,
  reviewer: <review _id RI>
  review: <review-text, max-length 140 chars RS>,
  film: <film-id RI>,
  createdAt: <created timestamp D>,*
  updatedAt: <updated timestamp D>*
}

// *Use mongoose timestamp feature
```


### Routes

#### GET

While the schemas should look like the data definitions above, these are descriptions of the data that should be returned from the various `GET` methods. You will need to use `lean`, `populate`, `select` and combining data to shape the appropriate response. 

##### `GET /studios`

```
[{ _id, name }]
```

##### `GET /studios/:id`

```
{ _id, name, address, films: [{ _id, title }] }
```

##### `GET /films`

```
[{ 
    _id, title, released, 
    studio: { _id, name } 
}]
```

##### `GET /films/:id`

```
{   
    title, released, 
    studio: { _id, name }, 
    cast: [{ 
        _id, role, 
        actor: { _id, name }
    }], 
    reviews: [{ 
        id, rating, review, 
        reviewer: { _id, name }
    ]
}
```
